          I guess you’re okay, for a Capricorn…HAHA. I know you hate my zodiac bullshit so thanks for putting up with my
          Leo ass. I can’t believe we were celebrating your bday earlier this year in Walmart Tahoe… A few of my
          favorite memories
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When our Shedevil landlord yelled at us for bringing wine in the common area (I would put up with her shit
            again if it meant being your neighbor)
          </li>
          <li>
            When we listened to your Daddy Dox presentation and you later received the job offer (where you are
            currently killing it)
          </li>
          <li>When you decided to try paddle boarding in Walmart Tahoe and you struggled back to the dock HAHAH</li>
          <li>
            When we killed it on the dance flo’ at your DoX holiday party (pictured below) and I ate my weight in
            dumplings
          </li>
          <li>
            It goes without saying that I LOVE YOU SO MUCH and I can’t wait to celebrate in-person with you. Big virtual
            bear hug ❤️

          I really miss hanging out with you (hoping to see you sooner rather than later). I’m so glad we hit it off
          that first trip to Monterey and then became fast friends after. You always make me snort laugh and I can’t
          wait for the adventures our little Aloha Ohana will go on (NY and then our INTERNATIONAL TRIP). Have the best
          birthday!

          So glad we’ve been able to stay in touch through the years. From talking about who knows what in the library
          during free period at Maine East to catching up in San Francisco, it’s always fun hangin!

          As your birthday month twin, I think back to how special you made my birthday and every event last year.
          Thanks to your adventurous spirit and fun loving nature Katherine and I were blessed with the absolute best
          apartment mates. You consistently bring so much light and joy to the lives of those around you. In a year like
          this one, I just wish everyone could have a friend like you.
        </div>
        <div>
          I love you so much and can't wait till we meet again in-person! Until then, have a wonderful birthday and a
          happy new year!

          B! I’m so grateful I talked you into moving to the Bay Area (yes I’m taking the credit). Since our beautiful
          adventures during Boeing, I knew you would be a lifelong friend. A few key memories to reminisce about: you
          scaring the sh*t out of me the night before our Lake Serene hike, you scaring the sh*t out of me by almost
          landing on me while cliff jumping, your spidey sense leading us the wrong way on the Mt Tam hike, us in Tahoe
          (2x), Breck, Hawaii, SLOvang, Issaquah, and back at 88 King. Excited for the adventures to come ❤️
